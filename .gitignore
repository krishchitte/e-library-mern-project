# Ignore all node_modules folders
**/node_modules

# Ignore all .env files (VERY IMPORTANT FOR SECURITY)
**/.env

# Ignore build output folder from React client
/client/build

# Ignore logs
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# Ignore OS-specific files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

**Why this is important:**
* `**/node_modules`: These folders contain thousands of files and can be easily reinstalled with `npm install`. They should never be uploaded.
* `**/.env`: This is the most critical rule. It prevents your database connection string and secret keys (like your JWT and reCAPTCHA secrets) from being uploaded to a public repository, protecting your application from being hacked.
